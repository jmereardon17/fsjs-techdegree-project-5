# Public API Employee Directory

An app for a fictional company called Awesome Startup, a distrubuted company with remote employees working all over the world. They need a start way for employees to share contact information with each other. This is a treehouse FSJS techdegree project.

Functionality I had to create:

- Use the Random User Generator API (https://randomuser.me) to grab information for 12 random "employees", and use that data to build a prototype for an Awesome Startup employee directory.
- Create the request to return a JSON object from the API and parse the data so that 12 employees are listed in a grid with their thumbnail image, full name, email, and location. Clicking the employee's image or name will open a modal window with more detailed information, such as the employee's birthday and address.
- Use my own JS (optionally allowed to use jQuery) to create the necessary functionality for this project.

Extra functonality to the highest grading:
- Search - Add a way to filter the directory by name, which I achieved by adjusting the API request to retrieve a user nationality that will only return data in the English alphabet. The search functionality filters results that are already on the page, so no extra requests are made.
- Modal toggle - Add a way to toggle back and forth between employees when the modal window is open. No errors can be found when reaching either the end or beginning of the list.
- Structure, style and CSS - I changed a lot of the styles on the page which makes up for a dark theme.

Grade: TBC
